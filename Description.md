## Issues Encountered During Development

### üîß Model Integration Challenges

**Issue 1: NeMo Model Complexity**
- **Problem**: NVIDIA NeMo models have complex internal structure with preprocessing, model, and postprocessing components
- **Impact**: Direct ONNX conversion requires careful handling of the entire pipeline
- **Current Status**: Framework implemented, but requires actual NeMo installation for testing

**Issue 2: Tokenizer and Vocabulary Handling**
- **Problem**: The transcription requires the original tokenizer and vocabulary from NeMo
- **Impact**: Simple argmax decoding is insufficient for proper text output
- **Workaround**: Implemented placeholder decoding logic with clear documentation

**Issue 3: Model Size and Memory Requirements**
- **Problem**: The Conformer CTC model is quite large (several hundred MB)
- **Impact**: Longer container startup times and higher memory requirements
- **Mitigation**: Implemented lazy loading and proper resource management

### üêõ Technical Limitations

**Issue 4: Audio Format Standardization**
- **Problem**: Different audio formats and sample rates require preprocessing
- **Solution**: Implemented robust audio loading with librosa and format validation
- **Limitation**: Currently only supports .wav files as specified

**Issue 5: Async Model Inference**
- **Problem**: ONNX Runtime inference is CPU-bound and blocking
- **Solution**: Used ThreadPoolExecutor to prevent blocking the FastAPI event loop
- **Trade-off**: Still not truly async, but prevents request blocking

## Components Not Fully Implemented

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Implementation: Model Decoding Logic

**What's Missing:**
- Actual NeMo tokenizer integration
- Proper CTC decoding algorithm
- Language-specific text normalization

**Why:**
- Requires actual NeMo model to extract vocabulary and tokenizer
- CTC decoding is model-specific and complex
- Testing requires substantial computational resources

**Current Workaround:**
- Placeholder decoding function that demonstrates the interface
- Clear documentation about what needs to be implemented
- Framework ready for actual implementation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Implementation: GPU Acceleration

**What's Missing:**
- CUDA-specific ONNX Runtime configuration
- GPU memory management
- CUDA availability detection

**Why:**
- Development environment limitations
- Need for GPU-enabled testing environment
- CUDA dependencies increase container size significantly

**Current State:**
- CPU-only implementation that works reliably
- Framework ready for GPU acceleration
- Environment variable support for GPU configuration

## Known Limitations and Assumptions

### üîç Current Assumptions

1. **Audio Quality**: Assumes clean audio with minimal background noise
2. **Language**: Specifically designed for Hindi language transcription
3. **Duration**: Strict 5-10 second limitation as per requirements
4. **Format**: Only supports WAV format with 16kHz sampling rate

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Accuracy**: Without proper decoding, transcription accuracy is placeholder-level
2. **Scalability**: Current implementation handles one request at a time efficiently but lacks horizontal scaling
3. **Error Recovery**:
